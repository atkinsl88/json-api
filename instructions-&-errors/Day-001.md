# Databasing
## NoSQL Databasing
### Installing Mongo (https://www.mongodb.com/)

1. Install the first command.
```
sudo mkdir -p ~/data/db
```

2. Install the second command.
```
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/data/db
```

3. Install the third command.
```
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```

4. Next, press the red ‘X’ on your terminal.

5. Then open your terminal again and write ‘mongo’. Run it and you should get a long list of text with a > at the end.
```
mongo
```

### Use a program called Mongoose to act as a translator 
(ORM stands for object relational mapping)

1. Take out the code in the middle so you are left with this.

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 4000

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Lisening on Port: ${port}`))
```

2. Then run `npm run start` in the terminal.

3. Then run  `npm I`

4. Then run `npm i mongoose`

5. Then kill the server and do this `npm I mongoose`

*Cannot get passed this point in my terminal, see screen shots below. So I am going to code out what I can and then hopefully test it later*

6. Then, you need to add a variable of mongoose and require it.

```
const moongoose = require('express')
```

7. Then,  you need to add the other variables, as so.

```
const express = require('express')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const app = express()
const port = 4000
const dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost/drag-race-db'


app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on Port: ${port}`))
```

8. Now can attempt to connect via Mongoose to the database location. Jack made some additional notes here to make the use of Mongoose’s latest technology. You don’t need to learn about them.

```
mongoose.connect(dbURI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true, useUnifiedTopology: true },
  (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
      return
    }
    console.log('Mongo has connected')
  })
```

Use Mongoose to connect to the database address.
Pars, etc not very important.
Pass callback function for errors.

9. Then, go into your terminal and type `nodemon index.js`. You should get this and now you have a port you can work from.

10. We make a schema, which is a fancy name for blue print.  This is where we define the ‘Queens’ in this case. 

```
const queenSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true  },
  season: { type: Number, required: true },
  isWinner: { type: Boolean, required: true, default: false },
  quote: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }
})
```

11. We then make a model, which registers it as an app.

```
const Queen = mongoose.model('Queen', queenSchema)
```

12. We need to make the app.get Queens function to fetch information (async) from the database, so we need to add the little async tag to the syntax. Then define a variable and ‘await’ Queen.find () information. ‘Find’ means go find them all.

```
app.get('/queens', async (req, res) => {
  const queens = await Queen.find()
  res.status(200).json(queens)
})
```

13. To test this we can go into Insomnia and create a single queen request.

14. Then, we’re going to create an app.post to do this. We can use try and catch, to do this part. First thing we’ll try is const createdQueen is await Queen (as everything goes through the model) and then use Queen.create and pass it an object.  This will be successful or it won’t and it will error out.

```
app.use(express.json())

/// Seperate these

app.post('/queens', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const createdQueen = await Queen.create(req.body)
    res.status(201).json(createdQueen)
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(err)
  }
})
```

15. Add some information into Insomnia, and add a new Queen.

```
{
	"name": "Liam",
	"season": 4,
	"isWinner": false,
	"quote": "Get these nuts out my face"
}
```

16. Now you can do a single Queen by adding the ‘Get a single Queen’ in Insomnia.

17. Back to VS Code, now we create the app.get elements for queenID.

```
app.get('/queens/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const queen = await Queen.findById(req.params.id)
  res.status(200).json(queen)
})
```

18. Replace with a little ‘if’ statement and include the 404 error so if you ask for one that doesn’t exist you just get a 404. Also add the throw new Error() part.

```
app.get('/queens/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const queen = await Queen.findById(req.params.id)
    if (!queen) throw new Error()
    res.status(200).json(queen)
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(404).json('Not Found')
  }
})
```
